<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This was a small project that helped to build an understanding of how a flask app works and refresh my webscraping/react skills in preparation for the ChessFlashCards project that I worked on. This project did not have any other purpose apart from education.

### How Does it Work?

`Shows user searching for laptops through the front end and clicking one of the web scraped amazon results`

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Instructions

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

1. Follow the procedure at the following website to configure the react project to be compatible with tailwindcss (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)

2. Initialize a python venv, set the environment variable FLASK_APP=app and run the command `flask run`

3. Start the frontend application with npm start

## Next Steps

- Mark certain sets as being easy/medium/hard to help change the frequency in which easy sets may occur.
- Animation for the movement of the pieces at some point to help make it easier to track which piece has moved.
